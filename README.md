Having visited a friend who works on a San Padre island, I was told of how lots of turtles die each year becasue people run them over driving on the beach. 
This inspired me while making a frogger clone for further edification and practice, to make it turtle themed.
Hopefully I will update this further and donate to my friend as a silly educational tool.
